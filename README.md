A perfect power is a classification of positive integers:

In mathematics, a perfect power is a positive integer that can be expressed as an integer power of another positive integer. More formally, n is a perfect power if there exist natural numbers m > 1, and k > 1 such that mk = n.

Your task is to check wheter a given integer is a perfect power. If it is a perfect power, return a pair m and k with mk = n as a proof. Otherwise return Nothing, Nil, null, NULL, None or your language's equivalent.

Note: For a perfect power, there might be several pairs. For example 81 = 3^4 = 9^2, so (3,4) and (9,2) are valid solutions. However, the tests take care of this, so if a number is a perfect power, return any pair that proves it.

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.

A squared string is a string of n lines, each substring being n characters long. We are given two n-squared strings. For example:

s1 = "abcd\nefgh\nijkl\nmnop" s2 = "qrst\nuvwx\nyz12\n3456"

Let us build a new string strng of size (n + 1) x n in the following way:

The first line of strng has the first char of the first line of s1 plus the chars of the last line of s2.
The second line of strng has the first two chars of the second line of s1 plus the chars of the penultimate line of s2 except the last char
and so on until the nth line of strng has the n chars of the nth line of s1 plus the first char of the first line of s2.
Calling this function compose(s1, s2) we have:

compose(s1, s2) -> "a3456\nefyz1\nijkuv\nmnopq"
or printed:
abcd    qrst  -->  a3456
efgh    uvwx       efyz1
ijkl    yz12       ijkuv
mnop    3456       mnopq

Write a program that will calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial of a given number.

N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * N

Be careful 1000! has 2568 digits...

For more info, see: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorial.html

Examples
zeros(6) = 1
6! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720 --> 1 trailing zero

zeros(12) = 2
12! = 479001600 --> 2 trailing zeros
Hint: You're not meant to calculate the factorial. Find another way to find the number of zeros.

# 5
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"

Don't give me five!
In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!

I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!

# 7
Return the century of the input year. The input will always be a 4 digit string, so there is no need for validation.

Examples
"1999" --> "20th"
"2011" --> "21st"
"2154" --> "22nd"
"2259" --> "23rd"
"1124" --> "12th"
"2000" --> "20th"

# 8
Write a function that receives two strings and returns n, where n is equal to the number of characters we should shift the first string forward to match the second. The check should be case sensitive.

For instance, take the strings "fatigue" and "tiguefa". In this case, the first string has been rotated 5 characters forward to produce the second string, so 5 would be returned.

If the second string isn't a valid rotation of the first string, the method returns -1.
Examples:
"coffee", "eecoff" => 2
"eecoff", "coffee" => 4
"moose", "Moose" => -1
"isn't", "'tisn" => 2
"Esham", "Esham" => 0
"dog", "god" => -1

# 9
You are provided with an array of positive integers and an additional integer n (n > 1).

Calculate the sum of each value in the array to the nth power. Then subtract the sum of the original array.

Examples
{1, 2, 3}, 3  -->  (1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 ) - (1 + 2 + 3)  -->  36 - 6  -->  30
{1, 2}, 5     -->  (1^5 + 2^5) - (1 + 2)             -->  33 - 3  -->  30

# 10
In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.
More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

Examples:
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
Note:
Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.

# 11
Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Examples(Input --> Output)
[1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
[2334454,5] --> [5, 2334454]
[1]         --> [1, 1]
Remarks
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

# 12
Complete the function that takes two integers (a, b, where a < b) and return an array of all integers between the input parameters, including them.

For example:

a = 1
b = 4
--> [1, 2, 3, 4]

# 13
Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language) that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that list.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5
Notes
You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.

# 14
Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
Good Luck!

# 15
In this simple exercise, you will create a program that will take two lists of integers, a and b. Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids a and b. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.

For example, if the parameters passed are ([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1]), the volume of a is 12 and the volume of b is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.

Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.

If you can, try writing it in one line of code.

# 16
Did you ever want to know how many days old are you? Complete the function which returns your age in days. The birthday is given in the following order: year, month, day.

For example if today is 30 November 2015 then

ageInDays(2015, 11, 1) returns "You are 29 days old"
The birthday is expected to be in the past.

Suggestions on how to improve the kata are welcome!

# 17
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'

# 18
ou're on your way to the market when you hear beautiful music coming from a nearby street performer. The notes come together like you wouln't believe as the musician puts together patterns of tunes. As you wonder what kind of algorithm you could use to shift octaves by 8 pitches or something silly like that, it dawns on you that you have been watching the musician for some 10 odd minutes. You ask, "how much do people normally tip for something like this?" The artist looks up. "It's always gonna be about tree fiddy."

It was then that you realize the musician was a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era! The Loch Ness Monster almost tricked you!

There are only 2 guaranteed ways to tell if you are speaking to The Loch Ness Monster: A) it is a 400 foot tall beast from the paleolithic era; B) it will ask you for tree fiddy.

Since Nessie is a master of disguise, the only way accurately tell is to look for the phrase "tree fiddy". Since you are tired of being grifted by this monster, the time has come to code a solution for finding The Loch Ness Monster. Note that the phrase can also be written 

# 19
Define String.prototype.toAlternatingCase (or a similar function/method such as to_alternating_case/toAlternatingCase/ToAlternatingCase in your selected language; see the initial solution for details) such that each lowercase letter becomes uppercase and each uppercase letter becomes lowercase. For example:

StringUtils.toAlternativeString("hello world") == "HELLO WORLD"
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("HELLO WORLD") == "hello world"
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("hello WORLD") == "HELLO world"
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("HeLLo WoRLD") == "hEllO wOrld"
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("12345") == "12345" // Non-alphabetical characters are unaffected
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("1a2b3c4d5e") == "1A2B3C4D5E"
StringUtils.toAlternativeString("StringUtils.toAlternatingCase") == "sTRINGuTILS.TOaLTERNATINGcASE"
As usual, your function/method should be pure, i.e. it should not mutate the original string.

# 20
Complete the function that takes a non-negative integer n as input, and returns a list of all the powers of 2 with the exponent ranging from 0 to n ( inclusive ).

Examples
n = 0  ==> [1]        # [2^0]
n = 1  ==> [1, 2]     # [2^0, 2^1]
n = 2  ==> [1, 2, 4]  # [2^0, 2^1, 2^2]
